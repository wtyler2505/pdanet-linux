Keyboard navigation and accessibility features fully functional. Profile management and usage analytics need fixes. Enhanced connection manager integration partially working. Data persistence completely broken - all configuration file operations failing. Recommend fixing data persistence first, then profile usage tracking and statistics calculations."
