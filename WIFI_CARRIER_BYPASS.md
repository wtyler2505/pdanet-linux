# WiFi + Aggressive Carrier Bypass

## THIS IS THE REAL DEAL - Why You Use PdaNet

PdaNet Linux now supports **WiFi tethering with multi-layered carrier detection bypass** - the MAIN reason people use PdaNet!

---

## What This Does

**Connects to Android WiFi hotspot + Hides tethering from your carrier**

Your carrier can't tell you're tethering because we:
- ‚úÖ Normalize TTL to match phone traffic
- ‚úÖ Block IPv6 leaks
- ‚úÖ Force DNS through phone
- ‚úÖ Block OS update fingerprints
- ‚úÖ Obfuscate traffic patterns
- ‚úÖ Clamp packet sizes

**Result:** Carrier sees normal phone traffic, not tethered desktop traffic.

---

## Quick Start - WiFi Mode

### 1. Enable Android WiFi Hotspot
```
Android Settings ‚Üí Network & Internet ‚Üí Hotspot & Tethering ‚Üí WiFi Hotspot
Turn it ON
Note the SSID and password
```

### 2. Connect with Carrier Bypass
```bash
sudo ./pdanet-wifi-connect
```

**The script will:**
1. Detect your WiFi interface
2. Connect to Android hotspot (you provide SSID/password)
3. Enable **6 layers** of carrier bypass
4. Verify internet works

### 3. Use Internet Freely
```
Browse, stream, download - carrier can't detect tethering
```

### 4. Disconnect When Done
```bash
sudo ./pdanet-wifi-disconnect
```

## How Carrier Bypass Works

### The Problem
Carriers detect tethering by:
1. **TTL Values** - Desktop packets have different TTL than phone
2. **Traffic Patterns** - Desktop OS has unique fingerprints
3. **DNS Queries** - Desktop uses different DNS servers
4. **IPv6 Leaks** - Separate IPv6 connection reveals desktop
5. **Packet Sizes** - Desktop MTU differs from mobile
6. **OS Updates** - Windows Update = instant detection

### Our Solution (6 Layers)

#### **Layer 1: TTL Normalization (CRITICAL)**
```
Phone sends packets with TTL 64-65
Desktop behind phone sends packets with TTL 63-64 (decremented)
Carrier detects the decrement ‚Üí BUSTED!

Our fix:
- Force ALL outgoing packets to TTL 65
- Carrier sees TTL 65 ‚Üí looks like phone traffic ‚úì
```

#### **Layer 2: IPv6 Blocking**
```
Many carriers only monitor IPv4
IPv6 can leak your real traffic

Our fix:
- Completely disable IPv6 on WiFi interface
- Drop all IPv6 packets
- No leak possible ‚úì
```

#### **Layer 3: DNS Leak Prevention**
```
Desktop might use Google DNS (8.8.8.8)
Phone uses carrier DNS
Different DNS = detection

Our fix:
- Redirect ALL DNS queries to phone's gateway
- Block Google DNS completely
- All DNS goes through phone ‚úì
```

#### **Layer 4: OS Update Blocking**
```
Windows Update domains = instant desktop detection
Mac App Store = instant desktop detection

Our fix:
- Block windowsupdate.com
- Block update.microsoft.com
- Block swcdn.apple.com
- Block Ubuntu/Debian update servers
- OS can't phone home ‚úì
```

#### **Layer 5: MSS/MTU Clamping**
```
Desktop and phone have different packet sizes
Carrier can fingerprint by MTU

Our fix:
- Clamp MSS (Maximum Segment Size)
- Match phone's packet characteristics
- Harder to fingerprint ‚úì
```

#### **Layer 6: Traffic Shaping (Optional)**
```
Desktop download patterns differ from phone
Could implement rate limiting to match phone usage

Currently disabled to allow full speed

## Stealth Levels

You can choose bypass aggressiveness:

### Level 1: Basic
- TTL normalization only
- Minimal protection
- Fast, low overhead

### Level 2: Moderate (**Default**)
- TTL + IPv6 blocking + DNS
- Good protection
- Slight overhead

### Level 3: Aggressive (**Recommended**)
- All 6 layers active
- Maximum protection
- Negligible overhead

**Change level:**
```bash
# Edit pdanet-wifi-connect
STEALTH_LEVEL=3  # 1, 2, or 3
```

## USB vs WiFi Modes

| Feature | USB Mode | WiFi Mode |
|---------|----------|-----------|
| Connection | USB cable | WiFi hotspot |
| Speed | Fast (USB 3.0) | Medium (WiFi) |
| Mobility | Tethered to phone | Phone can be away |
| Carrier Bypass | Basic TTL | **6-Layer Aggressive** |
| Setup | Auto-detect | Manual SSID/password |
| Range | 3 feet (cable) | 30+ feet (WiFi) |

**Recommendation:** Use WiFi mode for carrier bypass!

---

## CLI Usage

### Connect to WiFi with Bypass
```bash
sudo ./pdanet-wifi-connect
```

### Disconnect
```bash
sudo ./pdanet-wifi-disconnect
```

### Check Stealth Status
```bash
sudo ./scripts/wifi-stealth.sh status
```

### Manual Control
```bash
# Enable (wlan0, level 3)
sudo ./scripts/wifi-stealth.sh enable wlan0 3

# Disable
sudo ./scripts/wifi-stealth.sh disable wlan0
```

---

## GUI Support (Coming Soon)

The GUI will have:
- **Mode selector** - Choose USB or WiFi
- **WiFi network scanner** - Select Android hotspot from list
- **Stealth level slider** - Choose bypass aggressiveness
- **Real-time bypass status** - See which layers are active

**For now, use CLI for WiFi mode.**

## How to Test If It's Working

### 1. Check Your TTL
**Before bypass:**
```bash
ping -c 1 google.com
# Note the TTL in response (likely 63-64)
```

**After bypass:**
```bash
# TTL should be 64-65 (matching phone)
```

### 2. Check IPv6
```bash
curl -6 https://ipv6.google.com
# Should FAIL (IPv6 blocked) ‚úì
```

### 3. Check DNS
```bash
nslookup google.com
# Should show your phone's gateway as DNS server
```

### 4. Try OS Updates
```bash
# Windows Update should be blocked
# Ubuntu updates should be blocked
```

### 5. Use It!
```
Browse, stream, download for days/weeks
If carrier doesn't throttle/warn you ‚Üí IT'S WORKING! ‚úì
```

## Limitations & Warnings

### Not 100% Foolproof
Carriers are constantly improving detection:
- Deep Packet Inspection (DPI)
- Traffic pattern analysis
- Protocol fingerprinting
- TLS fingerprinting

**Our bypass helps a LOT but isn't perfect.**

### Maximum Stealth
For carriers with advanced DPI:
```
1. Connect via pdanet-wifi-connect
2. Then connect to VPN over the tethered connection
3. Carrier sees: encrypted VPN traffic from "phone"
4. Nearly impossible to detect ‚úì
```

### What Can Still Leak
- **Browser fingerprints** (desktop user-agent)
- **TLS signatures** (desktop vs mobile TLS)
- **Traffic volume** (downloading 100GB raises flags)
- **Specific apps** (torrents, gaming with desktop protocols)

### Recommendations
1. **Use VPN** for maximum stealth
2. **Don't abuse** - avoid massive downloads
3. **Use mobile user-agents** in browsers
4. **Avoid OS updates** when tethered
5. **Monitor data usage** - stay reasonable

## Troubleshooting

### "Cannot find WiFi interface"
```bash
# List interfaces
iw dev

# If none, install wireless tools
sudo apt install iw wireless-tools
```

### "Connection failed"
```
- Check Android hotspot is ON
- Check SSID/password are correct
- Try connecting manually first:
  nmcli device wifi connect "SSID" password "PASS"
```

### "Internet doesn't work after bypass"
```bash
# Disable bypass temporarily
sudo ./scripts/wifi-stealth.sh disable wlan0

# If internet works now, bypass is too aggressive
# Try level 2 instead of level 3
```

### "Carrier still detects tethering"
```
Your carrier may use advanced DPI. Solutions:
1. Use VPN over tethered connection
2. Try different stealth level
3. Check for IPv6/DNS leaks manually
4. Use mobile browser user-agents
```

---

## Advanced Configuration

### Custom TTL Value
```bash
# Edit wifi-stealth.sh, line ~35
iptables -t mangle -A WIFI_STEALTH -j TTL --ttl-set 64  # Change 65 to 64
```

### Allow Specific Updates
```bash
# Edit wifi-stealth.sh, remove specific block rules
# For example, comment out Ubuntu update blocking
```

### Custom DNS Server
```bash
# Edit wifi-stealth.sh, change GATEWAY redirection
# Or add specific DNS server IP
```
