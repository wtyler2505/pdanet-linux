# Carrier Detection Bypass - Technical Deep Dive

**Last Updated:** 2025-10-03
**Research Period:** 2024-2025 Carrier Detection Methods
**Implementation:** `scripts/wifi-stealth.sh`

## Executive Summary

Mobile carriers in 2024-2025 use sophisticated multi-layered detection systems combining heuristic analysis, Deep Packet Inspection (DPI), and machine learning to identify tethering. This document details the 6-layer bypass system implemented in PdaNet Linux and analyzes its effectiveness against modern detection methods.

## Carrier Detection Methods (2024-2025)

### 1. TTL (Time-To-Live) Decrement Detection

**Detection Mechanism:**
- Android devices send packets with TTL=64 by default
- When a device tethers, packets from the tethered device lose one TTL hop due to NAT
- Carrier sees packets with TTL=63, indicating one extra network hop
- Heuristic: If carrier sees mixed TTL=64 and TTL=63 from same subscriber, tethering is inferred

**Carrier Implementation:**
- Uses R&S®PACE 2 DPI engines or similar
- Real-time TTL monitoring at packet level
- Statistical analysis of TTL distributions
- High accuracy for naive tethering (>95%)

**Our Defense:**
```bash
# Set all outgoing packets to TTL 65 (matches native phone traffic)
iptables -t mangle -A WIFI_STEALTH -j TTL --ttl-set 65
ip6tables -t mangle -A WIFI_STEALTH -j HL --hl-set 65
```

**Effectiveness:** ✅ **HIGH** - Completely neutralizes TTL-based detection when properly configured

---

### 2. IPv6-Based Detection

**Detection Mechanism:**
- IPv6 eliminates NAT, making device boundaries easier to spot
- Carriers track multiple IPv6 addresses/prefixes from same subscriber
- DHCPv6/DUID fingerprints reveal multiple devices
- SLAAC/EUI-64 addresses show different MAC addresses
- Privacy extensions may help but not reliably

**Carrier Implementation:**
- IPv6 prefix delegation monitoring
- Device count via unique IPv6 addresses
- OS fingerprinting via IPv6 privacy extension patterns
- Moderate accuracy (60-70%)

**Our Defense:**
```bash
# Complete IPv6 blockade
sysctl -w net.ipv6.conf.wlan0.disable_ipv6=1
ip6tables -P INPUT DROP
ip6tables -P FORWARD DROP
ip6tables -P OUTPUT DROP
```

**Trade-off:** ⚠️ **No IPv6 connectivity** (acceptable for most use cases)

**Effectiveness:** ✅ **HIGH** - Eliminates IPv6 attack vector entirely

---

### 3. Deep Packet Inspection (DPI) Fingerprinting

**Detection Mechanism:**
- **TCP/IP Stack Differences:**
  - Sequence number patterns
  - TCP timestamp behaviors
  - Window size anomalies
  - Option ordering

- **TLS/QUIC Fingerprints:**
  - Client Hello signatures (ja3/ja3s)
  - Cipher suite ordering
  - Extension patterns
  - Chrome on Windows vs. Chrome on Android have distinct fingerprints

- **HTTP Analysis:**
  - User-Agent inconsistencies within same session
  - HTTP/2 fingerprinting (SETTINGS frame ordering)
  - Google QUIC user-agent mismatches

- **Application-Layer:**
  - App-specific protocols (Windows Update, Apple telemetry)
  - OS-specific DNS patterns
  - Background service traffic

**Carrier Implementation:**
- R&S®PACE 2 DPI plug-ins
- Per-flow analysis (not just per-packet)
- Multiple OS signature detection
- Very high accuracy (>80%)

**Our Defense:**
```bash
# Block OS-specific update services
iptables -A OUTPUT -m string --string "windowsupdate" --algo bm -j DROP
iptables -A OUTPUT -m string --string "update.microsoft" --algo bm -j DROP
iptables -A OUTPUT -m string --string "swcdn.apple.com" --algo bm -j DROP
iptables -A OUTPUT -m string --string "mesu.apple.com" --algo bm -j DROP
iptables -A OUTPUT -m string --string "archive.ubuntu.com" --algo bm -j DROP
iptables -A OUTPUT -m string --string "security.ubuntu.com" --algo bm -j DROP
```

**Limitations:**
- Cannot rewrite TLS fingerprints without full MITM proxy
- Cannot modify application-layer protocols
- String matching is brittle (URLs change)

**Effectiveness:** ⚠️ **MODERATE** - Blocks obvious desktop signatures, but sophisticated DPI can still detect anomalies

**Recommendation:** Use VPN over tethered connection for full DPI bypass

---

### 4. DNS Leak Detection

**Detection Mechanism:**
- Monitor DNS queries for desktop-specific domains
- Windows Update: windowsupdate.microsoft.com
- Mac App Store: mesu.apple.com
- Ubuntu repos: archive.ubuntu.com
- Google Analytics: analytics.google.com
- Desktop browser telemetry
- Split DNS (some queries to ISP, some to Google DNS)

**Carrier Implementation:**
- DNS query logging and analysis
- Domain classification (mobile vs. desktop)
- Query frequency patterns
- Moderate to high accuracy (65-75%)

**Our Defense:**
```bash
# Force all DNS through phone's gateway
GATEWAY=$(ip route | grep "default.*wlan0" | awk '{print $3}')
iptables -t nat -A OUTPUT -o wlan0 -p udp --dport 53 -j DNAT --to $GATEWAY:53
iptables -t nat -A OUTPUT -o wlan0 -p tcp --dport 53 -j DNAT --to $GATEWAY:53

# Block Google DNS specifically (common tethering indicator)
iptables -A OUTPUT -d 8.8.8.8 -j DROP
iptables -A OUTPUT -d 8.8.4.4 -j DROP
```

**Effectiveness:** ✅ **HIGH** - Forces all DNS through phone, preventing leaks

---

### 5. MSS/MTU Clamping

**Detection Mechanism:**
- TCP Maximum Segment Size (MSS) and Maximum Transmission Unit (MTU) values reveal routing boundaries
- Different MSS values indicate NAT or routing via intermediate device
- Carriers compare MSS values to expected phone defaults
- Effectiveness: **LOW** (secondary signal only)

**Carrier Implementation:**
- Passive MSS monitoring in TCP SYN packets
- Statistical analysis of MTU distributions
- Used as corroborating evidence, not primary detection

**Our Defense:**
```bash
# Clamp MSS to Path MTU
iptables -t mangle -A FORWARD -o wlan0 -p tcp --tcp-flags SYN,RST SYN -j TCPMSS --clamp-mss-to-pmtu
```

**Effectiveness:** ⚠️ **PARTIAL** - Helps reduce fingerprinting but not sufficient alone

---

### 6. Machine Learning Behavioral Analysis (2024-2025 Frontier)

**Detection Mechanism:**
- **Flow-Level Analysis:**
  - Packet size distributions
  - Inter-arrival times
  - Connection duration patterns
  - Application mix (Facebook vs. SSH)

- **Temporal Patterns:**
  - Time-of-day usage spikes
  - Simultaneous connections (desktop + phone apps)
  - Background traffic consistency

- **Volume Analysis:**
  - Total bandwidth usage
  - Upload/download ratio
  - Burst patterns (video streaming vs. file download)

- **Multi-Device Indicators:**
  - Diverse application signatures in short time windows
  - Parallel flows with different OS fingerprints
  - Inconsistent behavioral patterns

**Carrier Implementation:**
- ML models trained on labeled tethering datasets
- Anomaly detection (deviations from normal phone usage)
- Ensemble methods combining all signals
- Rapidly improving accuracy (currently 70-85%)

**Our Defense:**
```bash
# Traffic shaping (currently NOT implemented)
# Future: tc (traffic control) rules to:
#   - Limit bandwidth to phone-like levels (5-20 Mbps)
#   - Add jitter to connection patterns
#   - Throttle upload/download ratio
#   - Delay packets to smooth bursts
```

**Current Status:** ⚠️ **NOT IMPLEMENTED** - Prioritizing full speed over stealth

**Effectiveness:** ❌ **LOW** - No reliable defense against ML-based detection without comprehensive traffic mimicry

**Recommendation:**
1. Limit number of connected devices (1-2 maximum)
2. Avoid large downloads during peak hours
3. Use VPN to normalize all traffic patterns
4. Keep active connection time limited

## Recommended Strategies

### For Maximum Stealth

1. **Use Level 3 (Aggressive) bypass**
   ```bash
   sudo pdanet-wifi-connect  # Automatically enables Level 3
   ```

2. **Add VPN layer**
   - Run OpenVPN/WireGuard over tethered connection
   - Normalizes all traffic patterns
   - Defeats DPI and ML detection
   - Trade-off: Additional latency (~20-50ms)

3. **Behavioral Mimicry**
   - Limit connected devices (1-2 max)
   - Avoid simultaneous heavy uploads/downloads
   - Mix traffic patterns (web browsing + streaming)
   - Keep sessions under 2-3 hours

4. **Avoid High-Risk Activities**
   - Large torrent downloads
   - 24/7 streaming
   - Windows Update (blocked by default)
   - Cloud backup services (Dropbox, iCloud)

### Testing Your Stealth

**Verify TTL:**
```bash
ping -c 1 google.com
# Check TTL in response (should match phone's default)
```

**Verify IPv6 is blocked:**
```bash
curl -6 https://ipv6.google.com
# Should FAIL or timeout
```

**Verify DNS redirection:**
```bash
nslookup google.com
# Should show phone's gateway as DNS server
```

**Monitor carrier response:**
- Watch for throttling (speed tests before/after)
- Check for warning SMS/emails
- Monitor data usage reports for tethering classification

## Limitations and Risks

### Technical Limitations

1. **ML Detection is Evolving**
   - Current bypass methods may become obsolete
   - Carriers are investing heavily in ML-based systems
   - Behavioral analysis is hard to defeat

2. **IPv6 Blockade**
   - No IPv6 connectivity while stealth is active
   - Some services require IPv6 (rare in 2025)

3. **Performance Trade-offs**
   - Transparent proxy adds 10-20ms latency
   - Traffic shaping (if enabled) reduces speeds
   - Multiple iptables rules add CPU overhead

### Legal and Policy Risks

1. **Terms of Service Violations**
   - Most carriers prohibit tethering on unlimited plans
   - Could result in plan termination or throttling
   - Typically enforced via detection, not legal action

2. **Carrier Response**
   - Throttling to 2G speeds
   - Charging tethering fees
   - Plan downgrade or suspension
   - Warning messages

### Ethical Considerations

- Tethering is often prohibited on "unlimited" mobile plans
- Carriers use detection to enforce fair use policies
- Heavy tethering impacts network quality for other users
- Use responsibly and within your plan's terms where possible
