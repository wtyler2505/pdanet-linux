# Issue Triage

Intelligently triage and prioritize issues with automated routing and team assignment: **$ARGUMENTS**

## Current Triage Context

- Repository: !`gh repo view --json nameWithOwner -q .nameWithOwner 2>/dev/null || echo "No repo context"`
- Open issues: !`gh issue list --state open --limit 1 --json number | jq length 2>/dev/null || echo "Check manually"`
- Linear teams: Available Linear teams and project assignments for routing
- Triage backlog: Current volume and age of untriaged issues

## Task

Execute intelligent issue analysis with automated triage and priority assignment:

**Triage Scope**: Use $ARGUMENTS to focus on GitHub issues, Linear tasks, priority analysis, or team assignment optimization

**Triage Framework**:
1. **Issue Analysis** - Extract issue metadata, analyze content patterns, assess severity indicators, evaluate impact scope
2. **Category Classification** - Identify issue type (bug, feature, documentation), assess complexity level, determine urgency factors
3. **Priority Assessment** - Calculate priority score using severity, impact, effort, and business value metrics
4. **Team Routing** - Match issue skills to team expertise, balance workload distribution, consider current sprint capacity
5. **Label Management** - Apply consistent labeling scheme, maintain taxonomy standards, enable filtering and reporting
6. **SLA Assignment** - Set response time expectations, establish resolution targets, track performance metrics

**Advanced Features**: Automated severity detection, intelligent team matching, workload balancing, SLA monitoring, escalation workflows.

**Quality Assurance**: Consistency validation, triage accuracy tracking, team satisfaction monitoring, process optimization feedback.

**Output**: Complete issue triage with priority assignments, team routing recommendations, SLA targets, and process improvement insights.
