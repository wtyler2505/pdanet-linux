## 15. Lessons Learned Integration

### From Decision Quality Analysis

**Identified Biases to Avoid**:
- **Overconfidence Bias**: Mandatory code review, required testing
- **Confirmation Bias**: Structured evaluation of alternatives
- **Status Quo Bias**: Quarterly assumption challenges
- **Anchoring Bias**: Regular context re-evaluation
- **Planning Fallacy**: Realistic timelines with buffers

**Mitigation in Hybrid Approach**:
- Multi-criteria analysis prevents single-factor bias
- Probability assessments combat overconfidence
- Sensitivity analysis tests assumptions
- Phased approach allows course correction

### From Code Review Report

**Critical Findings Applied**:
- Security vulnerabilities drive Week 1 priority
