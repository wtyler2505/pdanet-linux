## 2. Bias Detection Analysis

### Identified Cognitive Biases

#### 🚨 **CRITICAL: Overconfidence Bias**

**Evidence**: 0% test coverage, 5 security vulnerabilities

**Manifestation**:
```python
# connection_manager.py:171 - Hardcoded absolute paths
result = subprocess.run(
    ["sudo", "/home/wtyler/pdanet-linux/pdanet-connect"],
    # NO error handling or validation
)

# config_manager.py:83 - No input validation
def set(self, key, value):
    self.config[key] = value  # Accepts ANY value!
```

**Impact**: Critical security vulnerabilities, production instability risk

**Mitigation Strategy**:
- Implement mandatory code review process
- Require 85% test coverage before deployment
- Security audit all subprocess calls
- Input validation framework for all user data

#### 🔶 **HIGH: Confirmation Bias**

**Evidence**: Python + GTK3 choice without objective evaluation

**Manifestation**: Framework scored 66% in multi-criteria analysis vs 78% for optimal choice (Go + Fyne/GTK)

**Decision Analysis**:
```
Multi-Criteria Scores (0-100%):
- Python + GTK3 (Current):  66% ← Chosen
- Go + Fyne/GTK:           78% ← Optimal
- Python + Qt5/6:          73% ← Better
- Java + Swing/JavaFX:     67% ← Similar
- Electron + JavaScript:   47% ← Poor
```

**Bias Indicators**:
- No documented evaluation of alternatives
- Choice aligned with developer's existing Python expertise
- Security criteria (20% weight) ignored (scored 40%)

**Mitigation Strategy**:
- Implement structured framework evaluation process
- Require justification for technology choices
- Include security expert in architecture decisions
- Document trade-offs explicitly in ADRs

#### 🔶 **HIGH: Status Quo Bias**

**Evidence**: God object pattern persists despite recognition

**Manifestation**:
```python
# pdanet_gui_v2.py - 646-line god object
class PdaNetGUI(Gtk.Window):
    def __init__(self):
        # Handles ALL responsibilities:
        # - Window management
        # - UI event handling
        # - State management
        # - Theme loading
        # - System tray management
        # - Settings management
```

**Impact**: High coupling, difficult testing, maintenance burden

**Mitigation Strategy**:
- Mandatory refactoring sprints for >500-line classes
- Architectural review board for design decisions
- Single Responsibility Principle enforcement
- Dependency injection implementation

#### 🔶 **MEDIUM: Anchoring Bias**

**Evidence**: Hardcoded paths from early implementation decisions

**Manifestation**:
```python
# Early decisions became "anchored" in codebase
HARDCODED_PATHS = [
    "/home/wtyler/pdanet-linux/pdanet-connect",
    "/home/wtyler/pdanet-linux/pdanet-disconnect"
]
```

**Impact**: Non-portable code, security risks, deployment issues

**Mitigation Strategy**:
- Regular "assumption challenges" in code reviews
- Configuration externalization mandate
- Path resolution using environment variables
- Deployment portability testing

#### 🔶 **MEDIUM: Planning Fallacy**

**Evidence**: Security implementation underestimated

**Manifestation**: 5 critical security vulnerabilities suggest complexity underestimation

**Specific Examples**:
1. Command injection via proxy configuration
2. Privilege escalation through hardcoded paths
3. Configuration injection without validation
4. Host injection in network tests
5. Missing credential management

**Mitigation Strategy**:
- Security-first development methodology
- Threat modeling for all network interactions
- Security review checkpoints in development
- External security audit requirement

### Bias Impact Assessment

| Bias Type | Severity | Current Impact | Potential Future Impact |
|---|---|---|---|
| Overconfidence | CRITICAL | 5 security vulnerabilities | Production compromise |
| Confirmation | HIGH | Suboptimal framework choice | Technical debt accumulation |
| Status Quo | HIGH | God object maintenance burden | Scalability limitations |
| Anchoring | MEDIUM | Deployment complexity | Platform lock-in |
| Planning Fallacy | MEDIUM | Security debt | Compliance failures |
