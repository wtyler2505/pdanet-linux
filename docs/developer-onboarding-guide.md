# PdaNet Linux - Developer Onboarding Guide

## Executive Summary

Welcome to the PdaNet Linux project - a security-critical network tethering application that implements advanced carrier detection bypass techniques. This comprehensive onboarding guide will prepare you for contributing to a complex codebase involving Linux networking, iptables manipulation, GTK3 GUI development, and carrier security research.

**ðŸš¨ SECURITY NOTICE**: This project involves privileged system operations, network manipulation, and security-sensitive code. All developers must complete security training before accessing production systems.

**Project Complexity**: High - Requires expertise in Linux networking, Python development, security practices, and carrier bypass techniques.

---

## 1. Project Overview & Business Context

### What is PdaNet Linux?

PdaNet Linux is a reverse-engineered Linux client for PdaNet+ USB/WiFi tethering that provides system-wide internet connectivity through Android devices. The primary value proposition is **6-layer carrier detection bypass** that prevents mobile carriers from detecting and throttling tethered traffic.

### Core Technologies

- **Frontend**: Python 3 + PyGObject (GTK3) with cyberpunk theme
- **Backend**: iptables, redsocks, NetworkManager integration
- **Security**: Transparent proxy redirection, TTL manipulation, traffic obfuscation
- **Platform**: Linux Mint 22.2 Cinnamon (Debian/Ubuntu-based)

### Business Critical Features

1. **WiFi Tethering with Carrier Bypass** (Primary)
   - 6-layer defense against carrier detection
   - TTL normalization, IPv6 blocking, DNS leak prevention
   - Traffic shaping and OS update blocking

2. **USB Tethering Mode** (Secondary)
   - Direct USB interface detection
   - HTTP proxy validation and redirection

3. **Professional GUI** (Supporting)
   - Real-time statistics, connection management
   - System tray integration, auto-reconnect

---

## 2. Security-First Onboarding (Week 1)

### ðŸš¨ Critical Security Training

**MANDATORY**: Complete before touching any code involving:
- `subprocess.run()` calls
- Network operations
- File system access with elevated privileges
- User input handling

#### Security Vulnerabilities Context

The project currently has **5 critical security vulnerabilities** identified in our code review:

1. **Command Injection** (`connection_manager.py:111-114`)
2. **Privilege Escalation** via hardcoded paths (`connection_manager.py:171`)
3. **Configuration Injection** (`config_manager.py:83-86`)
4. **Host Injection** in ping tests (`stats_collector.py:135`)
5. **Missing Credential Management**

#### Security Checklist

```python
# SECURITY REVIEW REQUIRED for any code containing:
SECURITY_REVIEW_PATTERNS = [
    "subprocess.run()",     # Command injection risk

## 4. Architecture Deep Dive (Week 1-2)

### System Architecture Overview

```
Android Device (PdaNet+ app)
         â†“
[USB Mode] OR [WiFi Mode]
         â†“
HTTP Proxy (192.168.49.1:8000) OR WiFi Gateway
         â†“
[6-Layer Carrier Bypass - WiFi Mode Only]
         â†“
redsocks (transparent proxy, port 12345)
         â†“
iptables NAT/mangle rules
         â†“
All Linux Applications
```

### Core Modules Architecture

```python
# Module Dependencies (from least to most dependent)
logger.py              # Logging foundation
config_manager.py      # Configuration persistence
stats_collector.py     # Bandwidth/latency tracking
connection_manager.py  # State machine + auto-reconnect
theme.py              # GTK3 CSS generation
pdanet_gui_v2.py      # Main GUI (646 lines - REFACTORING NEEDED)
```

### 6-Layer Carrier Bypass (Critical Knowledge)

**Layer 1 - TTL Normalization** (MOST IMPORTANT)
```bash
# Sets all outgoing packets to TTL 65 (phone-like)
iptables -t mangle -A WIFI_STEALTH -j TTL --ttl-set 65
```

**Layer 2 - IPv6 Complete Block**
```bash
# Disable IPv6 and drop all IPv6 packets
sysctl -w net.ipv6.conf.wlan0.disable_ipv6=1
ip6tables -A OUTPUT -j DROP
```

**Layer 3 - DNS Leak Prevention**
```bash
# Redirect all DNS to gateway
iptables -t nat -A OUTPUT -p udp --dport 53 -j DNAT --to-destination 192.168.1.1:53
```

**Layer 4 - OS Update Blocking**
```bash
# Block Windows/Mac/Ubuntu update servers
iptables -A OUTPUT -d windowsupdate.com -j DROP
```

**Layer 5 - MSS/MTU Clamping**
```bash
# Match phone packet characteristics
iptables -t mangle -A FORWARD -p tcp --tcp-flags SYN,RST SYN -j TCPMSS --clamp-mss-to-pmtu
```

**Layer 6 - Traffic Shaping** (Optional)
```bash
# Currently disabled for performance
# Can limit bandwidth to appear phone-like
```

### State Machine (ConnectionManager)

```python
class ConnectionState(Enum):
    DISCONNECTED = "disconnected"
    CONNECTING = "connecting"
    CONNECTED = "connected"
    DISCONNECTING = "disconnecting"
    ERROR = "error"
```

### Threading Model

```python
# CRITICAL: All UI updates must use GLib.idle_add()
def _connect_thread(self):
    # Heavy work in background thread
    result = subprocess.run(...)
    # UI update scheduled on main thread
    GLib.idle_add(self._on_connect_complete, result)
```

```python
# Before (vulnerable)
def set(self, key, value):
    self.config[key] = value

# After (secure) - YOUR TASK
def set(self, key, value):
    # Add validation here
    self._validate_config_key_value(key, value)
    self.config[key] = value
```

### Week 2: Architecture Tasks

class SystemTrayManager:           # ~100 lines
class SettingsDialog(Gtk.Dialog):  # ~150 lines
```

#### Task 9: Test Infrastructure
**CRITICAL**: Build comprehensive test suite (currently 0% coverage)

```python

## 15. Emergency Procedures & Incident Response

### Security Incident Response

**IMMEDIATE ACTIONS** if security vulnerability discovered:

1. **STOP**: Do not commit or deploy affected code
2. **ISOLATE**: Remove affected systems from network if needed
3. **ESCALATE**: Contact Security Architect immediately
4. **DOCUMENT**: Record all details of vulnerability
5. **REMEDIATE**: Follow security patch process

### Network Incident Response

**CARRIER BYPASS DETECTION** procedure:

1. **DETECT**: Monitor for unusual throttling or blocking
2. **ANALYZE**: Check which bypass layers may have failed
3. **ADJUST**: Modify stealth levels or techniques
4. **TEST**: Verify bypass effectiveness restored
5. **DOCUMENT**: Update bypass technique documentation

### Development Environment Issues

**CRITICAL SYSTEM ACCESS LOST**:

```bash
# Recovery procedures
sudo usermod -aG sudo $USER          # Restore sudo access
sudo systemctl restart redsocks     # Restart proxy service
sudo iptables-restore < /etc/iptables/rules.v4  # Restore network rules
```
