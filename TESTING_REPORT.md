✓ Connection manager executes appropriate script
✓ State changes trigger GUI callbacks
✓ Error messages propagate to GUI
✓ Button states update based on connection state
```

### Shell Scripts ↔ Connection Manager
```python
✓ Scripts discoverable via PATH or relative location
✓ Environment variables passed to scripts (IPHONE_SSID, IPHONE_PASSWORD)
✓ Script return codes checked (0 = success)
✓ Scripts run with sudo via subprocess
✓ Timeout protection (60s for WiFi connections)
```

### Stealth Mode Integration
```bash
✓ iPhone script calls wifi-stealth.sh
✓ Stealth level 3 (aggressive) by default
✓ 6 layers: TTL, IPv6, DNS, OS Updates, MSS/MTU, Traffic Shaping
✓ Proper cleanup on disconnect
✓ Status verification available
```

---

## 11. EDGE CASES & ERROR HANDLING

### Missing Credentials
```python
✓ GUI: Dialog cancellation returns None, connection aborted
✓ Script: Interactive prompt if env vars not set
✓ Connection Manager: Validates SSID presence before connecting
```

### Missing Scripts
```python
✓ Connection Manager: _find_script returns None if not found
✓ Error state set if script not found
✓ Error callback notifies GUI
✓ User sees error dialog
```

### Network Failures
```bash
✓ iPhone script: Checks if SSID visible in scan
✓ iPhone script: Verifies connection after attempt
✓ iPhone script: Tests internet connectivity
✓ Connection Manager: Monitor loop detects interface loss
✓ Auto-reconnect available if enabled
```

### Permission Issues
```bash
✓ All scripts check for root (EUID -ne 0)
✓ Clear error messages if not root
✓ install.sh configures sudoers for passwordless execution
```

---

## 12. SECURITY ANALYSIS

### Input Validation
```python
✓ IP addresses validated (ipaddress.ip_address)
✓ Port numbers validated (1-65535 range)
✓ Hostnames validated (RFC 1123 regex)
✓ No shell injection vulnerabilities (subprocess with arrays)
```

### Path Security
```python
✓ No hardcoded paths in critical code
✓ Script discovery uses safe methods
✓ PATH respected but not blindly trusted
```

### Credential Handling
```bash
✓ Passwords not echoed to terminal (read -rs)
✓ Passwords not logged
✓ Environment variables cleared after use
```

---

## 13. PERFORMANCE CONSIDERATIONS

### GUI Responsiveness
```python
✓ Connection operations run in background threads
✓ 1-second update interval for display
✓ GLib.idle_add used for thread-safe GUI updates
✓ No blocking operations on main thread
```

### Resource Usage
```python
✓ Single instance lock prevents multiple GUIs
✓ Monitoring loop has 1-second sleep
✓ Logs limited to recent 50 entries
✓ No memory leaks in connection manager
```
